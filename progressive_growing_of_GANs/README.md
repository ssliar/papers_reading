# progressive_growing_of_GANs
Pure tensorflow implementation of progressive growing of GANs [https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196] 

Includes :
* Progressive growing of network
* Use of minibatch standard deviation
* Pixelwise feature normalization
* Equalized learning rate
* Drift loss

Tested on private dataset.  

See `training_walkthrough.ipynb` on how to train on your own dataset.
